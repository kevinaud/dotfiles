# Just Programmer's Manual

Each line of each recipe is executed by a fresh shell, so it is not possible to
share environment variables between recipes.

Some tools, like [Python’s venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
require loading environment variables in order to work, making them challenging
to use with `just`. As a workaround, you can execute the virtual environment
binaries directly:

```just

venv:
  [ -d foo ] || python3 -m venv foo

run: venv
  ./foo/bin/python3 main.py
```
